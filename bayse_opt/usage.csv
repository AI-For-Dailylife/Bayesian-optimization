No.,
1,Open [bayse_opt]->[search_space_x]->[range_of_data]
2,"In [range_of_data], determine the search range."
3,"In the top line, write the name of the material type."
4,"In the second line, write the minimum value of each material."
5,The third line is the maximum value of each material.
6,The bottom line tells how often to search.
7,Open [search_space_x.py] in an IDE (such as Spyder).
8,"If you set flag = 1 in line 16, the sum of the materials in one sample will be 100."
9,"If you set flag = 0 in line 16, the sum of the materials in one sample is not limited."
10,The file [search_space_x.csv] will be generated. Copy it and paste it into [bayse_opt].
11,"Open [experimental_data.csv] and select some conditions from [search_space_x.csv] in column C and later, and paste them."
12,Delete the selected conditions from [search_space_x.csv].
13,"In column B, write the results of the experiment."
14,"In column A, write the sample number."
15,Open [maximize_minimize.csv]. Rewrite 1 for maximization and 0 for minimization.
16,Run [bayse_opt.py].
17,The results will be saved in [next_experiment_sample.csv]. Write the conditions and results in [experimental_data.csv].
18,Repeat steps 16 and 17.
